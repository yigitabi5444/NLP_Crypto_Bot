Money printing is the poor alternative that the authorities resort to because it is practically and ideologically/politically impossible to have the appropriate, fair and tax and redistribution system that we should rationally have.

The fact that we've allowed our money to be infinitely printed and humans have greed and emotion means that would never be possible which is why bitcoin needs to exist.", "Yeah everyone always says bitcoin is an inflation hedge but It\u2019s odd that in the last year inflation has hit 8% and yet bitcoin has lost 50%+ of its value.", "Inflation is a \"temporary\" price fluctuation upward, it is as temporary as the ratio of scarcity to money supply ratio is. If there is no money supply leaving existence or an increase in supply of products to bring the ratio down then it will not change, but if either side of the equation changes the value will also change. Inflation is when the average price of products goes up as the ratio gets larger. Deflation is when prices go down due to the ratio becoming smaller.\n\nIt's true that inflation isn't transitory in the sense that without the money supply going down and/or the product supply going up that ratio is not going to change over time.\n\nIn this sense the forward progress of technology (manufacturing capability and more capable product) is deflationary and technological regress due to loss of fabrication and manufacturing capabilities is inflationary.\n\nFor example, computers used to be much more expensive but as our ability to miniaturize the parts allowed less resources to be used to create a better product so the prices deflated. If our manufactering capabilities go down but our money supply is roughly the same prices will go up which is inflationary.\n\nInflation is measured by what a discrete unit of currency can buy of a discrete unit of good over time. Inflation and deflation are both a measure of changing value, this value is changing over time. That means that both are potentially temporary and practically speaking nothing lasts forever, at some point the entire universe will die a \"heat death\".\n\nEverything that is not constantly fed energy in the form of time and labor is temporary. Even cryptocurrencies require constant energy and computational power to survive, although as long as those needs are met and the supply isn't expanded they don't suffer from inflation from that side of the ratio, but the amount of stuff available for purchase does affect their value on the market.  The less units of material goods available the more units of bitcoin they will cost per unit of good. The more material goods the less bitcoin they will cost per unit of good.\n\nCrypto can only lock the size of the money supply but the production of goods side will always be variable based on enviromental factors.", "Cars aren\u2019t currencies.

People think of gold this way but even that hasn't performed like that in a long time.

To be clear, I am very pro-Bitcoin and own a decent stack of sats (not a 1BTCer yet tho) but I find it helps me understand how to set up my market position the better I understand economic systems.  I know the stuff I wrote here not because I am some social media economist but rather because I spend a lot of time learning from those who are, and I like to consider different views so I can get a wider perspective on the market.  My current staples The Uneducated Economist and Heresy Financial (both on Youtube.)", "I have very clearly laid out the facts that the value of something is determined by the ratio of supply verses demand.  Demand is increased by expanding the money supply and population, it is reduced by contracting the money supply and population.  Supply is increased by more production, and decreased by wear and tear destroying older assets and production below replacement levels.  The money supply has been expanded and never contracted, if the money supply was contracted this would have deflationary effects bringing house prices down.  This means that the value of something changes moment to moment and in this sense is temporary, it can go up or down depending on how that ratio of supply and demand changes over time.  An additional variable, however, is that the population now is MUCH bigger and the housing supply has lagged behind.  If the housing supply was expanded and the money supply and population contracted houses could cost the same as they did in 1960.  Bitcoin can prevent the money supply being expanded, but it's not going to stop population growth increasing demand or cause more houses to be built.  One thing to note however, is that although Bitcoin has a theoretical limit, its supply IS increased when new Bitcoin is mined and this means it also will suffer from a small amount of inflation until it reaches it's theoretical maximum.", "If the accord was trying to be the super car that a Ferrari is, then you would see more comparisons. \n\nYou don\u2019t see people comparing the yen to bitcoin, because yen isn\u2019t trying to be a global currency.", "People saw inflation coming back in 2020 and 2021 when we saw how much they had printed.

Here is some general advice.\n\n1)\tDo you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin. (you can use bitcoin to save money but don't speculate with it as an investment)\n\n2)\tDo you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt\n\n3)\tHave a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.\n\n4)\tHave no debt and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.\n\n5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?\n\nThe answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.\n\nHere is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com\n\nThus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\n1)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\n2)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.", "WassaWassaWassup!
