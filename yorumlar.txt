If there is no money supply leaving existence or an increase in supply of products to bring the ratio down then it will not change, but if either side of the equation changes the value will also change. Inflation is when the average price of products goes up as the ratio gets larger. Deflation is when prices go down due to the ratio becoming smaller.\n\nIt's true that inflation isn't transitory in the sense that without the money supply going down and/or the product supply going up that ratio is not going to change over time.\n\nIn this sense the forward progress of technology (manufacturing capability and more capable product) is deflationary and technological regress due to loss of fabrication and manufacturing capabilities is inflationary.\n\nFor example, computers used to be much more expensive but as our ability to miniaturize the parts allowed less resources to be used to create a better product so the prices deflated. If our manufactering capabilities go down but our money supply is roughly the same prices will go up which is inflationary.\n\nInflation is measured by what a discrete unit of currency can buy of a discrete unit of good over time. Inflation and deflation are both a measure of changing value, this value is changing over time. That means that both are potentially temporary and practically speaking nothing lasts forever, at some point the entire universe will die a \"heat death\".\n\nEverything that is not constantly fed energy in the form of time and labor is temporary. Even cryptocurrencies require constant energy and computational power to survive, although as long as those needs are met and the supply isn't expanded they don't suffer from inflation from that side of the ratio, but the amount of stuff available for purchase does affect their value on the market.  The less units of material goods available the more units of bitcoin they will cost per unit of good. The more material goods the less bitcoin they will cost per unit of good.\n\nCrypto can only lock the size of the money supply but the production of goods side will always be variable based on enviromental factors.", "Cars aren\u2019t currencies.

Demand is increased by expanding the money supply and population, it is reduced by contracting the money supply and population.  Supply is increased by more production, and decreased by wear and tear destroying older assets and production below replacement levels.  The money supply has been expanded and never contracted, if the money supply was contracted this would have deflationary effects bringing house prices down.  This means that the value of something changes moment to moment and in this sense is temporary, it can go up or down depending on how that ratio of supply and demand changes over time.  An additional variable, however, is that the population now is MUCH bigger and the housing supply has lagged behind.  If the housing supply was expanded and the money supply and population contracted houses could cost the same as they did in 1960.  Bitcoin can prevent the money supply being expanded, but it's not going to stop population growth increasing demand or cause more houses to be built.  One thing to note however, is that although Bitcoin has a theoretical limit, its supply IS increased when new Bitcoin is mined and this means it also will suffer from a small amount of inflation until it reaches it's theoretical maximum.", "If the accord was trying to be the super car that a Ferrari is, then you would see more comparisons. \n\nYou don\u2019t see people comparing the yen to bitcoin, because yen isn\u2019t trying to be a global currency.", "People saw inflation coming back in 2020 and 2021 when we saw how much they had printed.

Here is some general advice.\n\n1)\tDo you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin. (you can use bitcoin to save money but don't speculate with it as an investment)\n\n2)\tDo you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt\n\n3)\tHave a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.\n\n4)\tHave no debt and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.\n\n5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?\n\nThe answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.\n\nHere is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com\n\nThus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\n1)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\n2)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.", "WassaWassaWassup!

The newest ASICs are already down to 3nm , to put things in perspective Intels most expensive retail chips are still at 10nm , there really isn't that much more room for BTC ASICs to shrink which means decentralization of mining . There are also many fundamental misunderstandings people have towards the advantageous and disadvantageous in industrial mining.\n\nA few things you need to understand about mining \u2013\n\nChipmakers like TSMC and Samsung as 2 examples (Soon to add intel to this list) are the ones that are commissioned to make most ASIC chips(not the full assembled ASIC miner) based upon designs from Bitcoin ASIC manufactures. These foundries are involved in diverse chip making and obviously aren't directly involved in Bitcoin or its politics but fulfilling large orders from whoever commissions them.\n\nThe most popular ASIC manufacturers for Bitcoin right now are Whatsminer, Innosilicon, Bitmain, Caanan, Ebit, and Ebang. Many more ASIC manufacturers exist but they come and go based upon merit in a highly competitive race. For example Bitfury used to be one of the best manufacturers , and now has very little market share. Bitmain used to dominate , and than made some poor design decisions (lead engineer left them) and now competes with at least 4 others for the most efficient ASICs. This is a highly competitive and changing ecosystem.\n\nLarge miners main advantage is economies of scale over smaller miners. If you are an ASIC manufacturer you have large advantage over others because you can premine off your newest hardware and sell you last generation ASICs to others. This does occur , but is simplistic view and not the full picture. The reality is ASIC manufacturers Sell their newest ASICs with partners for industrial mining , sell their latest hardware to smaller miners for a premium, and mine themselves, while at the same time selling older ASICs on the market. Why do they do this? Because ASIC manufacturing is highly competitive and they need to hedge their investments as quickly as possible and de-risk from regulatory concerns as well.\n\nAmateur mining doesn't come with many risks of manufacturers who come and go (they are forced to make huge investments in ASIC orders and have long development pipelines fraught with risks)\n\nAmateur mining does not have the overhead of employees , security, regulatory compliance, building costs, tax liabilities , etc...\n\nNow here is what is interesting, this last generation of ASICs that went from 7nm to 5nm in size did not have the same efficiency jumps as previous drops. This is because 5nm is already at the edge of what can be done with silicone, we can possibly shrink down to 2-3nm but it gets extremely difficult as the gates start to get the size of a few atoms wide and quantum concerns and heat become a very big concern.\n\nWhy is any of this important?\n\nIn the past when ASICs went from 14nm to 12nm there was larger improvements in efficiencies which gave an advantage towards those who could manufacture and mine themselves and their partners. ASICs would become obsolete sooner 8 months to 1 year at times which makes it difficult for amateur miners to recoup their investment in an ASIC especially those that by the slightly older generation equipment.\n\nAs moore's cliff approaches (we are already there as I don't see 2nm  anytime soon) this means that this latest generation of ASICs will have a much longer shelf life which means the variable above is much less important and the greater importance is a complex mix of what sort of electrical rates you can get - overhead costs.\nNow remember what I said about the advantageous of amateur mining. Industrial mining has other advantageous too like economies of scale and specialization but many disadvantageous as well.\n\nWhat this ultimately means is we are entering a period of commoditization in mining(the opposite of centralization). The economics force this direction. industrial miners will still exist but more and more amateur miners will enter the ecosystem. Eventually new companies will be also created that create products to recycle the waste heat (already exists , but prices will start to drop considerably for consumers)", "> not anyone can mine Bitcoin.\n\nAnyone can buy an ASIC, I'm not sure what you mean", "WassaWassaWassup!
